# Requirements

Business Requirements 

This web application is intending to solve objective problems facing pet owners and stray animals.
For the pet ownerâ€™s side: Efficiency for looking for missing pets, efficiency in adopting an animal, and reporting a missing pet.
For the stray animals: Find a lovely home and get connected to the owner.


User Requirements

Petfinder provides user management functionality that allows users to register, login, logout, and visit their profile, and search/report missing animals. The navigation adapts depending on whether a user is logged in or not, and depending on their role in the application. There are two types of users or roles. A user can be a regular user or an admin. 
The user interface adapts to the user role by hiding certain links, or entire pages and functionality. For instance, The Admin will have access to the administration page that would otherwise be inaccessible to the rest of the users of the application. The use cases for the two types of users are different to warrant different user interfaces. However, the login, register, and some profile content will stay the same interface.
